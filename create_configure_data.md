The publication process and data formatting are described in  these documents available from the Tutorials page:

[Survey Formatting Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4ABDP1YrEU3vRxYkIPHl9dyGTT4w3pqfRNI2Kn97Ic/pub?embedded=true)

[Survey Publishing Step-by-Step](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9UGvVO3ZHS2L8Rqk6vBEZiBlIaVBIZy1k0MCVtfDq4/edit)

SuAVE can use CSV files uploaded from your computer, import CSV files from a web URL, or retrieve data from a URL each time SuAVE loads. The latter is  especially useful if you have independently updated data files, e.g.,  google spreadsheets or files generated on database queries.

A reference to a Google sheet that SuAVE can accept looks like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XwupwRD-Y-wz3NIeft4uq4dvXZmIIv8o2tekHKk8jA/export?format=csv&gid=886577023)
