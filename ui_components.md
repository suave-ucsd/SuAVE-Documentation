1. SuAVE logo. Click it to open SuAVE main web page
2. Title of the application. When a SuAVE survey is embedded in a web page, these two items may not be needed. To hide them, replace https://suave.sdsc.edu/main/... with https://suave.sdsc.edu/suave.html?... in the survey URL.
3. A set of buttons or icons (depending on version) to a) switch to full screen mode, b) annotate a  view, c) generate a URL for a given view snapshot, d) view user-focused videos,  e) view survey metadata as entered by survey publisher, f) search for items in a survey, g) save current subset as a CSV file, h) customize survey settings, including display of missing values, which variables to show, and which variable to use as a dynamic text over survey items
4. Zoom-in/out slider.
5. Drop-down list of survey variables. This selection determines how items are organized (sorted) in data views
6. A set of icons for switching between different views and  integrations. In the picture above, grid, bucket, cross-tab and map views are available, with the bucket view being the active view. Other views may present the survey data in a table, a list, a network diagram, and a heat map, or provide a link to Jupyter hubs for additional processing.     
7. Information about what is currently selected, and how many items are in the selection. Here, paintings from years 1900-05 are in the  selection.
8. Left panel is used to search for variables and text, and to select  items to appear in the canvas by using facets. There are different types of facets for multiple-choice/multiple-response, numeric, and date  variables. Further, some variables can be only searchable by text but  wonâ€™t appear in the facets (eg responses to open-ended questions), or  will only show up in the information view on the right side.
9. The main canvas showing selected items. Users can pan and zoom in  and out on the items, and make them active (then the right panel will  show additional item information).
10. Additional links to SuAVE project information and Settings (where  users can only select a subset of variables to display in SuAVE).
