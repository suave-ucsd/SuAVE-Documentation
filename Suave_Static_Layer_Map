1. **Clone an existing SuAVE survey**. Navigate to  any dataset you find at http://suave.sdsc.edu (see that the dataset is  hosted on the suave-dev.sdsc.edu server) or at http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/gallery/zaslavsk, http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/gallery/ilyaj, http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/gallery/public (these are public views of my survey collections. Once you create a SuAVE account, your *public* surveys will similarly be visible at http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/gallery/%3Cyour_user_name>. You can set a survey to *private* if you don’t want it to be included in your public gallery.) To clone a dataset, click the “Jupyter“ button at the top right of the survey  opened in SuAVE, and then click “Clone.” A copy of the survey will be  placed in your survey gallery (you may need to refresh it). If the  Jupyter button is not shown, change the “views” attribute in the URL  such that the seventh digit is “1”. For example, change  [http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/main/file=public_picolo2.csv&views=111000**0**&view=grid](http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/main/file=public_picolo2.csv&views=1110000&view=grid) to [http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/main/file=public_picolo2.csv&views=111000**1**&view=grid](http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/main/file=public_picolo2.csv&views=1110001&view=grid).
