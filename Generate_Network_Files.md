### Here are the steps you will need to follow:

1. Go to [http://corpus-db.sdsc.edu/](http://corpus-db.sdsc.edu/)

2. Enter your email and project name that is reflective of the network files you will generate.

3. Select the search type of your choosing, either Scope or Opex Alex Author ID. Also, choose whether or not to exclude pieces based with more than a certain number of coauthors (default is 25).

   1. Scope
      1. Enter keywords to "Scope". Make sure to cover all possible uses of the words/phrases you include; check the "blacksmith" example on the site for an example.
      2. Choose to allow relaxed match or not. If you choose "relaxed match", this means that for phrases like "transboundary aquifer", "transboundary" and "aquifer" can show up anywhere in the piece in any order.
   2. OpenAlex Author IDs
      1. If you know the OpenAlex Author IDs of the people you want to include in you search, choose this option. Enter the desired IDs.
      2. You have the option to include external collaborations and collaborations within the author's instituion. Including these options are up to you depending on the scope of the generation you want.

4. Next, tag authors by certain keywords in the title and/or abstract. Think of certain relevant keywords to group authors by, place them here. If you want to exclude files that do not contain any of the keywords, click the box next to "Exclude from result if none of the above keywords are present".

5. Choose whether you want to narrow your search based on year published.

6. Choose whether you want the network files to include only certain instituions.

   1. Also choose whether you want to limit the scope of network files generated on collaborating institutions for the piece.

7. After some time, you should be sent a link with an access code. Click the link and enter your access code, which will prompt you to download the csv and Netvis .json for the network file generation.
