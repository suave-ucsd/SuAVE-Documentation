# Share Different Views with Collaborators

When looking at a SuAVE visualization, you can look at the different view options by clicking the options in the top right corner. In order to share a specific view, follow these instructions.

1. Open the Suave visualization.
2. Copy the url.
  a. The url should look something like this:

suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=grid

Change the url from &view=grid to &view=netvis

Your url should look something like this now:

suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=netvis

Now, whenever you share this link, it will initialize the SuAVE gallery with the Netvis view.
