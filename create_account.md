You need a SuAVE account to publish and clone surveys, create  annotations, and work with Jupyter notebooks. In SuAVE, you  also need an account to update item information in applications  configured for user editing.

To create an account, navigate to MySurveys, or, alternatively, directly to http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/, http://suave-stage.sdsc.edu/, or http://suave2.sdsc.edu/, and select “Create an Account”. Once your account is created, you will see your personal survey gallery, which will be initially empty.
