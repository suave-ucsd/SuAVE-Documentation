# Publish a Tabular Dataset

**Requirement**: A dataset (typically in the form of a curated file of survey responses), where the first row are the column titles and the following rows are the completed entries. This can be a CSV file, a Google Sheet, or a similar tabular document on the Web. 

1. Go to [https://suave-net.sdsc.edu/home](https://suave-net.sdsc.edu/home).
2. If you do not have an account, click [here](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/create_account.html) to create one.
3. Follow the step-by-step publishing guide and file formatting guidelines linked [here](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/create_configure_data.html). 
    - The file formatting guidelines are optional - but would make your analysis more efficient. For example, adding data type qualifiers to variable names (#date, #number, #info, #long, etc.) will have SuAVE apply special type-specific visualizations to the data. Also, you may specify a variable to show as dynamic text over images, URLs to follow, etc. Most of these can be also modified at the next step (survey configuration.)
4. Configure your newly created survey, by selecting Edit-Settings on the survey in the personal gallery. Customization options: [https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/customizing_surveys.html](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/customizing_surveys.html)
5. If you want to publish datasets with associated images:
    - Finding images online and adding them to SuAVE: [https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/find_images_for_your_survey.html](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/find_images_for_your_survey.html)
    - Add images (in the scenario where each response in the dataset relates to a person and you would like for the image of each response to be that person): [https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/Bibliographic_Network_Images.html](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/Bibliographic_Network_Images.html)
