# Survey Data Files

The types of data files include:

- Static CSV files uploaded to SuAVE servers from your local computer
- Static CSV files imported into SuAVE from some web URL (in v. 2)
- Dynamic CSV files, retrieved each time a survey is loaded (in v. 2). Such files can be stored as Google spreadsheets, generated by some  regular process, or created on database queries. For example, you may  have a Google forms application writing in a Google spreadsheet, and  configure a SuAVE survey to load that spreadsheet.
