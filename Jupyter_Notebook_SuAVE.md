# Accessing Jupyter Notebooks Tied with SuAVE Visualizations

Before following the steps below, look at the overview given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hE7fin7xvYcFWCa1ukDo8bAH5-ipo6CgWHsObm4cFM/edit#heading=h.rwpzgzb98mp5).

1. Navigate to the desired SuAVE visualization.
2. Select the Jupyter Hub logo in the top right (with all the view options).
3. Select the NRP Nautilus server and hit "Connect".
    - If you do not have an account with NRP Nautilus, you will need to request access with a verified academic email [here](https://element.nrp-nautilus.io/#/room/#general:matrix.nrp-nautilus.io/$otJHIgxLiCsRjsqEFnM9mfgxutSmHhnpfIb1YQfuRVE).
    - Once you are approved, you will also need to ask for access to the Jupyter Hub.
4. Once you are approved to access the Jupyter Hub (if needed), you will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook tied to the SuAVE visualization.
