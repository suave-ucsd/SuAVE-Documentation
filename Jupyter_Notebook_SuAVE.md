# Adding a Jupyter Notebook of a SuAVE Visualization

Follow the steps listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hE7fin7xvYcFWCa1ukDo8bAH5-ipo6CgWHsObm4cFM/edit#heading=h.rwpzgzb98mp5).


# Accessing a Jupyter Notebook Tied with a SuAVE Visualization

1. Navigate to the desired SuAVE visualization.
2. Select the Jupyter Hub logo in the top right (with all the view options).
   - If you do not see this option, you will have to add the Jupyter Notebook tied to the SuAVE visualization to the Jupyter Hub.
4. Select the NRP Nautilus server and hit "Connect".
    - If you do not have an account with NRP Nautilus, you will need to create an account [here](https://portal.nrp-nautilus.io) and request access with that verified academic email [here](https://element.nrp-nautilus.io/#/room/#general:matrix.nrp-nautilus.io/$otJHIgxLiCsRjsqEFnM9mfgxutSmHhnpfIb1YQfuRVE).
    - Once you are approved, you will also need to ask for access to the Jupyter Hub.
5. Once you are approved to access the Jupyter Hub (if needed), you will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook tied to the SuAVE visualization.
