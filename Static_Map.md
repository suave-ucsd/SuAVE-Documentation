# Static Map Layers to the Map

1. **Create the map**: Navigate to [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/?hl=en](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/?hl=en). Click on "CREATE A NEW MAP" in the top left. Name the map and the level fittingly. Then, click on "Share" (on the screen where you are viewing the specific map you are creating), and copy the link.

2. **Import survey to map**: Make sure your dataset has a location identifier (best if that identifier is Latitude and Longitude). Under your map layer, click "Import" and choose the csv of the dataset. This should populate observations on the map. Download your map as a .kmz file by clicking "Export to KML/KMZ". Make sure to check "Keep data up to date with network link KML".

3. **Add map to SuAVE Visualization**:Follow the normal steps for uploading a dataset to SuAVE. Once the visualization is done, navigate to the "Settings" of the survey. Under "Overlay KML Link", upload your map.

4. This will populate a SuAVE gallery with a static map, which can be seen by clicking "Map View" in the top left of the screen when viewing the visualization.
