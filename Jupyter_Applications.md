# SuAVE-Jupyter Notebooks

**One of the attractive features of SuAVE is the ability to invoke Jupyter notebooks for additional processing of surveys and image collections. Such notebooks may implement statistical analyses, image processing, machine learning, data mining, semantic image tagging, and other operations. Several sample notebooks are available on github at [https://github.com/suave-ucsd/jupyter-suave](https://github.com/suave-ucsd/jupyter-suave).**
