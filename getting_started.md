# Getting Started

**Su**rvey **A**nalysis via **V**isual **E**xploration (SuAVE, http://suave.sdsc.edu) is an online exploratory data analysis system. It has been used in  multiple areas, including social and electoral surveys, visual arts and  humanities, biology and ecology, and the geosciences.

SuAVE integrates visual, statistical and cartographic analyses, and  lets users annotate and share images or distribution patterns. It also  integrates with Jupyter notebooks and R for additional analysis.

Mouse over Gallery to see SuAVE applications and click any of them to explore. See [Tutorials](http://suave.sdsc.edu/tutorials/) and [Blog](http://suave.sdsc.edu/blog/) for introduction to analysis with SuAVE.
