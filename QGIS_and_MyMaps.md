# QGIS and MyMaps

<b><u>Utilizing QGIS and SuAVE</u></b>

**QGIS is a free, open-source software that allows users to create, edit, and analyze maps from data. To utilize this site for your data, follow the instructions below.**

To learn how to add an ***active map layer*** to your SuAVE application, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11svfo8De-zz79xaeXOxFRHfIdBaDX61O4ZmQPV7z8BQ/edit?pli=1). An example active map can be found [here](https://suave2.sdsc.edu/main/file=suavedemos_SDG_Indicators_2018.csv&view=map).


<b><u>Utilizing MyMaps and SuAVE</u></b>

**MyMaps is a free site created by Google that allows users to create maps from data. To utilize this site for your data, follow the instructions below.**

To learn how to add a ***static map*** to your SuAVE application, click [here](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/Add_Map_SuAVE.html).


***Sidenote***

The main difference for static and active maps in the context of SuAVE visualizations is the ability for the map to adapt when only select entries are selected in SuAVE. Static maps show the full map at all times whereas active maps can be adjusted in SuAVE to only view certain entries (by selecting those entries). Furthermore, QGIS offer more analysis tools but can be difficult to utilize them in a successful way. Therefore, ***use MyMaps when you simply want to include a map and QGIS when you want a more interactive map with tools for analysis***.
