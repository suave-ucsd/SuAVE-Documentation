This NDC-C workshop helped us to connect with the SAGE researchers  and understad the SAGE platform better, speak to the researchers directly about the capabilities of SAGE ecosystem and how to get access to the SAGE nodes. We also discussed about directly involving graduate and undergraduate students. We also discussed with the CloudLab team about using their infrastructure for summer school.  Additionally,  we discussed with ""National Data Platform Pilot: Services for Equitable Open Access to Data"" project to create a data catalogue.","Workshop helped addressing the major road-blocks, such as infrastructure access and data access.
