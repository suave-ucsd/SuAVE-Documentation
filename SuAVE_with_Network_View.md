* Make sure your SuAVE visualization has a Netvis .json file associated with it. If not, follow the steps [here](https://suave-ucsd.github.io/SuAVE-Documentation/Network_Files_SuAVE.html).

Once you have completed this, to share and open the SuAVE Visualization with Netvis view, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your SuAVE Visualization.

2. Copy the url.

   1. The url should look something like this: 

      > suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=grid

3. Change the url from &view=grid to &view=netvis

   1. Your url should look something like this now:

      > suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=netvis

Now, whenever you share this link, it will initialize the SuAVE gallery with the Netvis view.
