* Make sure your SuAVE visualization has a Netvis .json file associated with it. If not, follow the steps in "Adding Network Files to SuAVE".

Once you have completed this, to share and open the SuAVE Visualization with Netvis view, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your SuAVE Visualization.

2. Copy the url.

   1. The url should look something like this: 

      > suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=grid

3. Change the url from &view=grid to &view=netvis

   1. Your url should look something like this now:

      > suave-net.sdsc.edu/main/[SURVEY INFO]&view=netvis

Now, whenever you share this link, it will initialize the SuAVE gallery with the Netvis view.
